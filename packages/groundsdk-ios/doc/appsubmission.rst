Sky Controller 3 & iOS App submission
-------------------------------------

Supporting the SkyController 3 on a published iOS application requires a
validation from our part under the MFI program, or your application will
be rejected by Apple.

In order to get your app approved under the MFI program, we will require the
following information:

#. Your application Bundle ID
#. The first version number that will support the SkyController 3
#. A description of your application (similar to what you put on the app store)
#. A description of the features available with the SkyController 3, which can
   help testing.

If you want to get your app validated, please contact us via private message
with all the information on the `developer forum`_

We will also require a TestFlight access to at last one test build with
SkyController 3 support
