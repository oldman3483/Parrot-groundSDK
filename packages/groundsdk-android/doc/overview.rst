Overview
========

The GroundSdk Android framework allows the user to develop its Android applications
to fly the ANAFI and get its video stream. All the features of the ANAFI drone
are exploitable and usable through a easy-to-use, fully documented Java API.

GroundSdk and all the libraries that compose it are available in ready-to-compile
source code. The code is released under the
BSD-3 license along with an installation guide, API documentation, and a
ready-to-use demo application with a clear feature set.
